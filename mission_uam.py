Script Version 1.2
Python Mission: Create Threat Investigation & Response Automation Workflow
Mission Steps
Step 1. In AMP for Endpoints, get a list of all the events of "Threat Detected" and "Executed Malware" types 
        for a specific computer named `Demo_AMP_Threat_Audit`, capture malicious sha256 associated with the first event.
Missions to complete: MISSION01, MISSION02, MISSION03
Step 2. Isolate infected Computer to perform further investigation and make sure that the action was successful.
Missions to complete: MISSION04
Step 3. In Threat Grid, find all samples, associated with malicious sha256 that you have captured in step 1 
        and look at analysis report for the first sample on the list.
Missions to complete: MISSION05, MISSION06
Step 4. Request all domains for a specific sample in Threat Grid and store them in an array to get more data out of them.
Missions to complete: MISSION07
Step 5. Check all associated domains against Umbrella Investigate to retrieve their status.
Missions to complete: MISSION08, MISSION09, MISSION10
Step 6. Using Umbrella Enforcement, post malware events to the API for processing and optionally adding 
        to a customer's domain lists.
Missions to complete: MISSION11
Step 7. Using Threat Response, inspect if malicious sha256 has been found on our network. 
        Use response capabilities of AMP for Endpoints module to block this malicious file from execution 
        on all Computers in our network.
Missions to complete: MISSION12, MISSION13, MISSION14
Step 8. Use response capabilities of AMP for Endpoints module in CTR to block this malicious file 
        from execution on all Computers in our network.
Missions to complete: MISSION15
Step 9: Uncomment the validation section and submit solution for review.
